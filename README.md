AstroApp boilerplate
====================
A React Native boilerplate with batteries included.
It comes with:

- [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) for easy routing
- [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) so you can use lots of icons
- [react-native-spinkit](https://github.com/maxs15/react-native-spinkit) for awesome loading icons
- react-native-drawer for cool side menus
- [native-base](nativebase.io) components
- [redux](redux.js.org/) application state management

# Usage
We strongly recommend you to not clone directly and use our CLI [astroman](https://github.com/Astrocoders/astroman) to help you build awesome apps. Check out `astroman`'s README for more.

### Todo
- Make Meteor integration and user system patchable
